# My-Portfolio

https://devonmm3.github.io/My-Portfolio/

Updated portfolio, completed exactly half way through Coding Boot Camp.  I updated the hyperlinks, added CSS (my own and Bootstrap), included a link to my email, and added 3 deployed projects. My plan is to continue to add my projects as I complete them and to continue to improve upon the design.
