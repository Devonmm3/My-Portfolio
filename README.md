# My-Portfolio

Updated Portfolio after 10 weeks of Bootcamp.  I added the external links to Linkedin and, my email, Github, Twitter and three of my projects.

Future plans are to add a sign up sheet for a mailing list, continue to add projects as I finish them, and to eventually link it to the personal recipe blog I am working on designing for myself.
