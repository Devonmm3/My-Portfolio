        </div>
        <p>This app is meant to emulate Amazon and it is appropreiately named "Bamazon". It used JS, My MQL and the npm
          install package to use mysql and prompt. The products are organized into "Product ID, Product Name,
          Department Name, Price and stock quantity". The User is asked to input the ID of the item he or she would
          like to buy, and then is prompted to enter a number that they want to buy. If it is less than the stock
          quantity, they are able to "buy" and it shows the total price. If they want more than the number in stock,
          they are given an given a prompt that says that there is not that enough in the stock quantity. They are then
          asked if they would like to make a second purchage and have to input "y" for yes and "n" for no. If they say
          yes, the list of products is displayed again and they are asked for the Product ID and the process repeats.</p>

        </div>
        <p>To briefly summarize the scoring for this form of bowling: ● One game of bowling is made up of ten frames. ●
          In each frame, the bowler has two throws to knock down all the pins. ● Possible results for a frame: o Strike
          (‘X’): the bowler knocks down all 10 pins on the first throw. The frame is over early. The score for the
          frame is 10 plus the total pins knocked down on the next two throws. o Spare (‘/’): the bowler knocks down
          all 10 pins using two throws. The score for the frame is 10 plus the number of pins knocked down on the next
          throw. o Open frame: the bowler knocks down less than 10 pins with his two throws. The score for the frame is
          the total number of pins knocked down.</p>
