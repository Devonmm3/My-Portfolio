                <p>I am Full Stack Engineer who graduated from George Washington Universityâ€™s Coding Bootcamp. I have
                    extensive training in Front end and Back end web development, and an intense passion and drive to
                    continue learning. I also hold a Bachelor's Degree in literature from the University of
                    Connecticut, and have a rich and diverse background in Education, customer service, department
                    management, insurance, and health and fitness. These skills have guided me to having a vast amount
                    of creativity, compassion and the knowledge of how important it is to treat people well, balanced
                    with
                    working efficient and hungry work ethic are the keys to truly be successful in any field.

            I grew up in Connecticut, and after college I moved to California, where I worked in hospitality, insurance
            and mentored a third grade class at a charter school. I also discovered my love of yoga, and became a
            certified
            yoga teacher and taught all over San Diego County. I decided to relocate to the East Coast to be closer
            to my family in 2016.</p>
            <p>After moving to Northern Virginia, I decided that I wanted to be a part of the tech world. I love
                the
                fast
                pace of the industry, and that there are always more things to learn and discover. I also feel very
                strongly
                that Tech needs more women in the industry, and I want to be a part of it. My technical skills include
                HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, Node.js, jQuery, and Firebase. I am so happy to
                have been a part
                of
                the George Washington Bootcamp and I can't wait to see what the future holds for me.</p>
            <p>Some of my favorite things to do are yoga, cooking (specifically vegan food), work out at the gym,
                read,
                spend time with my dog and be outside.</p>
